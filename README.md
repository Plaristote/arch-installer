This repository contains a ruby library providing a simple DSL to configure an Archlinux system.
It comes with the default setup I use for my own machines.

## How to use

Boot from an Archlinux installation device, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
cd arch-install
bin/run archlinux # will use the `archlinux.rb` configuration file
```
